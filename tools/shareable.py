The shareable tool is used to convert tweet datasets into shareable datasets.
As per `Twitter's Developer Policy <https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy>`_, only tweet IDs can be shared.
Therefore this tool retains only the tweet IDs from corpora.

To run this tool, use the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/shareable.py
