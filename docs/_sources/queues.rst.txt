   :description: The queue functionality of EvenTDT
   :keywords: Python, TDT, queue

EvenTDT collects tweets and processes them.
In-between collecting and processing, the tweets go into a queue data structure.
In this way, the consumers can process the data in the same order as it was received.
The queue functionality is a special class.
