"""
The :class:`~queues.consumers.split_consumer.SplitConsumer` builds on the base :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer` class, but splits the incoming stream of tweets into several streams.
These streams are simply a list of :class:`~queues.Queue` instances.

The :class:`~queues.consumers.split_consumer.SplitConsumer` creates as many :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer` instances as there :class:`~queues.Queue` instancesâ€”one :class:`~queues.Queue` for each :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer`.
All consumers process the tweets in their own :class:`~queues.Queue` as usual.

The way the consumer splits the stream depends entirely on the the implementation.
The consumer can assign each tweet to just one stream, to multiple streams, or even discard tweets.

.. note::

	The :class:`~queues.consumers.split_consumer.SplitConsumer` is based on the :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer` class, so it operates in real-time.
	All this means is that it sends tweets to the appropriate consumer without delay.
	The processing, however, does not have to be in real-time.
	The individual consumers that process the split streams can be based on the :class:`~queues.consumers.buffered_consumer.BufferedConsumer` and process tweets in batches.

	The :class:`~queues.consumers.split_consumer.SplitConsumer` class acts as a supervisor.
	It reads all of the incoming tweets and dispatches them to one of its consumers.

	In its state, the consumer maintains a list of these conditions.
	Associated with each condition is one class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer` that receives the tweets from that split.

	This class mainly re-works the basic consumption method to decide where to send off tweets.
	To change how the consumer works, you might need to override the following functions:

	- :func:`~queues.consumers.split_consumer.SplitConsumer._preprocess`: Pre-process all incoming tweets.
	  This function is used whenever the child consumers all perform the same pre-processing tasks.
	  When tweets can be added to multiple streams, this function can improve efficiency.
