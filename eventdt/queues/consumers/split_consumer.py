"""
The :class:`~queues.consumers.split_consumer.SplitConsumer` builds on the base :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer` class, but splits the incoming stream of tweets into several streams.
These streams are simply a list of :class:`~queues.Queue` instances.

The :class:`~queues.consumers.split_consumer.SplitConsumer` creates as many :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer` instances as there :class:`~queues.Queue` instancesâ€”one :class:`~queues.Queue` for each :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer`.
All consumers process the tweets in their own :class:`~queues.Queue` as usual.

The way the consumer splits the stream depends entirely on the the implementation.
The consumer can assign each tweet to just one stream, to multiple streams, or even discard tweets.

.. note::

	The :class:`~queues.consumers.split_consumer.SplitConsumer` is based on the :class:`~queues.consumers.Consumer` class, so it operates in real-time.
	All this means is that it sends tweets to the appropriate consumer without delay.
	The processing, however, does not have to be in real-time.
	The individual consumers that process the split streams can be based on the :class:`~queues.consumers.buffered_consumer.BufferedConsumer` and process tweets in batches.
