Attribute extraction is the problem of extracting attributes and their values for classes or their instances.
All methods are based on the :class:`~attributes.extractors.Extractor` class, which performs operations to extract attributes.
Finally, it returns a :class:`~attributes.profile.Profile` class, which serves as a container for these attributes.
