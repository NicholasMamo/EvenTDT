"""
Cataldi et al.'s algorithm was among the first to introduce the notion of nutrition and burst.
The feature-pivot TDT algorithm first calculates the worth of terms as nutrition.
Then, periodically, it calculates the burst of these terms.
Burst is a measure of how much a term is bursting.

The calculations for burst are based on time windows.
Therefore calls to :func:`~tdt.algorithms.cataldi.Cataldi.detect` should give the timestamp of the time window with respect to which the burst is to be calculated.

This implementation calculates the burst of terms based on the given nutrition.

.. note::

	Implementation based on the algorithm presented in `Personalized Emerging Topic Detection Based on a Term Aging Model by Cataldi et al. (2014) <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2542182.2542189>`_.
