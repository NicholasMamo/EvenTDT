"""
Event TimeLine Detection (ELD) is a feature-pivot TDT approach designed to create interpretable results.
The algorithm computes burst for each individual term.
The interpretation is in the form of a burst value that lies between -1 and 1.
-1 indicates that a term is losing popularity, and 1 that it is gaining popularity.
When the burst is 0, the term's popularity is unchanged.

The broader system routinely creates checkpoints that represent the importance of terms in a particular time window.
The implemented TDT algorithm compares the documents received in the last time window with the previous checkpoints.

ELD borrows the terminology from Cataldi et al.'s previous work and algorithm: :class:`~tdt.algorithms.cataldi.Cataldi`.
This algorithm computes burst based on the past nutritions stored in the checkpoints.

.. note::

	Implementation based on the algorithm outlined in `ELD: Event TimeLine Detection -- A Participant-Based Approach to Tracking Events by Mamo et al. (2019) <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3342220.3344921>`_.
	ELD is a combined document-pivot and feature-pivot TDT approach.
	The algorithm in this module is the feature-pivot technique.
