"""
The Document Graph Summarizer (DGS) algorithm takes in documents and builds a summary.
The algorithm is not greedy and constructs a document graph, which it then splits into communities.
Considering each community to be a different facet, the algorithm picks documents from the largest communities.
In this way, the algorithm can maximize precision by minimizing redundancy.

.. note::

	Implementation based on the algorithm presented in `ELD: Event TimeLine Detectionâ€”A Participant-Based Approach to Tracking Events by Mamo et al. (2019) <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3342220.3344921>`_.
