Who will perform better in tonight's match? Anthony Martial or Pierre Emerick Aubameyang … @TheMisterIyanu @Zeee_zah Anthony martial. Retarded mourinho playing with 7 defenders.

That corner flag is taller than Torreira? Herh! The corner flag is taller than Torreira?! The corner flag is taller than Torreira.
Eric bailly no way near match fit and bullying arsenal. Oh look, Eric Bailly doing Eric Bailly things. Our best defender. Who'd have guessed? 🤔🤔. I don’t understand how man was leaving Eric Bailly out, the man is a fucking tank.
“This is my friend, Eric Bailly! The best centre back in the world." So glad to see him back in the XI. BEAST! Has Bellerin ever had a good shot? I still get scared when Bellerin has the ball.
United look decent. Arsenal look decent. Huh. Weird. I’ve missed Eric Bailly and his shenanigans so much. I missed Eric Bailly 😂😂😂😂.
No Arsenal is the type of club that would win North London derby to make it 19 game unbeaten but then lose to Manchester United… “This is my friend, Eric Bailly! The best centre back in the world." So glad to see him back in the XI. BEAST! Arsenal starting to control the game now.
Where’s these comments and jokes about de gea that Pickford got? Terrible error , shows even the best makes mistakes. David De Gea is unbelievable but that’s so poor. We are that wank it’s rubbing off on the best goal keeper in the world 👍. the only differences between De Gea and Jordan Pickford is the beard and the teams they play for, otherwise very similar mistakes between the two!
De Gea gifts Arsenal the first goal through Mustafi's header. 1-0 Arsenal. Pooja Football. Really poor from De Gea from Mustafi's header. Crossed the line before Herrera could clear away. seriously, wtf were Kolasinac and Iwobi doing there? especially Iwobi, just fucking stick your foot out and clear it 😂.
@Arsenal Iwobi lets the ball roll into DDGs feet, the counter, get a freekick, and score the freekick. What a fucken idiot. Martial dives to win a free kick and Herrera is offside with the assist that comes from that free kick. Arsenal are definitely not winning this game. Every time we play a team they always have to dive to get a goal. I swear down next season I hope to god that any player dives against Arsenal should get a straight red card for diving in sick and tired of players getting away with it 🤬🤬.
He's a gunman, saves Mourinho's job on the daily, short sleeves black gloves, Tonyyyyyyy. @gooner145 Never mind the five, the goal was offside. Herrera is offside when the kick is taken and he then crosses to Martial. It's going from bad to worse. Rob Holding is coming off, looks like a knee injury.
Not even a free kick and Herrera offside, can’t wait for VAR cunting refs. Arsenal getting mugged by Offside yet again! Just bring in VAR already ffs. Another offside leading to a goal. @premierleague living in the stone age without VAR.
Paul Pogba cost £89m, Romelu Lukaku cost £75m and Fred cost £47m. All together they cost the club £211m and neither of the 3 start tonight. “But José wasn’t backed.”. stop giving freekicks around our box..... De Gea purposely conceding a goal so we would start playing good football. What a fucking keeper. Best in the world.
@David_Neres7 @TheAngelRole @FutbolLouiss True but everyone makes mistakes and De Gea has saved us too many times for us to blame him for making a mistake. Rob Holding is leaving the pitch on a stretcher after an earlier challenge by Rashford. Lichtsteiner is going to come on. Wins the ball and gets a yellow but Lingard yet to receive a card for 3 bad fouls.
When Mustafi gets a yellow for the same as that by Rojo. I mean, that’s a scissor foul, red every day surely? Fuck the yellow! Rojo having a great game, loves a challenge 😂😂 about time a player showed some fight!! When ref throws around yellows like this, he has to give Torreira a yellow for that... refs losing control and now he’s worries about throwing another yellow because he’s worried to give a red. But that’s a clear yellow there on Torreira.
Why no Christmas card for Arsenal this time ref it’s like the bloody post office sorting office at the moment cards cards cards 🙄🙄🙄🙄. 50 game 💩 bias ref several reds not given 20 game 💩 ref 1 red not given What have they got in common Old Trafford 😛😛. I see red cards in this match (ManUnited vs Arsenal) with the pace the ref is dishing out yellow cards.
38’ - Rojo announces himself back at in the team by launching into another tackle and earns a yellow. Bellerin into the book. Marriner looks to have been talked into it by . Really poor refereeing at play here. For the second time in 4 days, the referee and his assistants have cost arsenal at half time. It’s ridiculous how much this happens. United are only level due to cheating from martial and the referee.
Matic taking one for the team as usual for these useless cunts. Anthony Martial equalises for @ManUtd - his 7th goal in his last 8 PL apps ⚽ Most goals for Man Utd in current squad: 44 MARTIAL 42 Mata 34 Rashford 32 Lukaku. Matic is soo slow on the ball ffs bench this guy 😤.
This arsenal game, yellow cards are being dished out the way Uhuru gives jobs to old men. De Gea purposely conceding a goal so we would start playing good football. What a fucking keeper. Best in the world. Technology puts us 1-0 up, allow technology to keep us 1-0 up, marginal offside but 1mm or 100m offside is offside. Can’t argue with technology.
@ManUtd @AnthonyMartial Aren't both Arsenal and United better in the second half? I think we need to decide now who is second half FC before this gets confusing. @Gemma_Finnegan @BromellKieran So @btsport just said 75% of @Arsenal goals have come in the second half. Also 100% of our second half goals have come in the second half so we will score! Brexit Maths. If Arsenal are beast in the second half, we are the official founding member of the Second Half Fc. Let’s go for it reds.@ManUtd.
HT in the Premier League: Burnley 0-0 Liverpool Fulham 1-0 Leicester Man Utd 1-1 Arsenal Tottenham 1-0 Southampton Everton 1-1 Newcastle Wolves 0-1 Chelsea. HT: Man Utd 1 Arsenal 1 - Entertaining first half for the neutral, feisty at times. More of the same, please. Arsenal can't wait for VAR next season. We have been cheated for so many years. At least, next season we can ask for a VAR decision instead of accepting whatever the referee calls. The game should've been one-nil to us.
De Gea purposely conceding a goal so we would start playing good football. What a fucking keeper. Best in the world. Arsenal fans at Old Trafford: "We want you to stay. We want you to staaaaayyy! Jose Mourinho! We want you to stay." h… Arsenal didn't get out of 2nd gear in that first half. Unfortunately to be 1-1 since Man U's goal was offside, but hey ho. Boys need to be better 2nd half. Some magical Emery magic during the break will do the job 👌.
Andre Marriner is fishing out cards like campaign money aye! Andre Marriner loves a shocker against Arsenal, but truth be told we've not done enough so far. Andre Marriner 📣⚽️dashing out yellow cards like 😂😂🤣.
@wan_tesla @manlikeaegon @Arsenal And we lost, ever since he took the back seat, we've never lost, get it mate? Ander Herrera's first half vs. Arsenal by numbers: 88% pass accuracy most tackles attempted (5) most interceptions (4) most tackles won (3) 1 chance created 1 assist Improves Man Utd's midfield. 👍👍👍.
Arsenal are still yet to lead a Premier League game at half-time this season. 15 games and counting now... … “Thank You Chelsea FC for Matic” is the most premature line of FT in recent years. Arsenal fans singing: “Jose Mourinho, we want you to stay.”.
Ander Herrera's first half vs. Arsenal by numbers: 88% pass accuracy most tackles attempted (5) most interceptions (4) most tackles won (3) 1 chance created 1 assist Improves Man Utd's midfield. 👍👍👍. Absolutely gutted about Rob Holding, has really stepped up this season! Making himself a regular in the defence! Get well soon and come back even stronger 👍@RobHolding95 @Arsenal. Ander Herrera made more interceptions (4) and more tackles (3) than any other player on the pitch in the first half at Old Trafford. "Mad dog" 🐶.
Manchester United fan, Tyson Fury, want his rematch with Wilder at Old Trafford in the summer! De Gea, Alisson Kepa all battling for the worst keeper of the night, DDG leading the way currently. Just seen Tyson Fury at Old Trafford with a man Utd scarf on come on Wilder lad 😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Liverpool losing. Chelsea drawing. Massive to go and get 3 points now. Come on Arsenal. GOOALLL!! Martial scores his 8th of the season! Manchester United 1-1 Arsenal. 🔴⚪️⚫️. Started the move and finished it. Marcos Rojo, welcome back!
🎉 Only two @ManchesterUnited players have scored a @PremierLeague goal on their birthday: 📅 24 October 2004 ⚽️ @WayneRooney 🆚 @Arsenal 📅 5 December 2018 ⚽️ @AnthonyMartial 🆚 @Arsenal 🎁 Birthday present from the Gunners. 📝 @OptaJoe. Birthday vibes!!!!! @Anthonymartial is the second Manchester United player 2 score a P'League goal on his birthday, after Wayne Rooney in October 2004 (also vs Arsenal) .
De Gea purposely conceding a goal so we would start playing good football. What a fucking keeper. Best in the world. Best goal keeper in PL people. Have a look. Arsenal leads 1-0. Sheesh United are fighting relegation with De Gea. Best keeper in the world.
Wilder Fury rematch at Old Trafford in summer 2019, anyone? ✋ That's what @Tyson_Fury wants! 🍿 "I got robbed blind in America but we continue to the next fight!" 👊.
Let's hope Torreira isn't injured as well . Imagine if Torreira comes off injured too lol. Did Torreira just miss the ball, get grounded by Martial, and managed to injure himself.
Absolutely class Bailly 👏🏻. The pace of Bailly 🔥. Aubameyang races Bailly. Bailly wins. Spins Aubameyang. Keeps the ball. Passes it off. My defender.
Please get Lingard and Matic off this pitch. Sub in Pogba for matic and we win this. Jose gunna sub Pogba in for Lingard when it should be for Matic i know it.
Dalot has been amazing. Get Mata on please. This is so much better from United. Bailly and Rojo making a huge difference!
Kolasinac's final ball very poor tonight. Wonder why we haven't used the right at all? Would fancy Bellerin taking in Darmian. Dalot is struggling against kolasinac's pace. why is Kolasinac not putting that in first time ffs.
Lukaku will come on and score the winner typical. Lukaku hasn't done shit all season but bet your house he'll score the winner tonight. Lukaku to score the winner. Remember this tweet.
Finally Iwobi out. Shouldn't have come back from the break. David De gea when he sees Jordan Pickford. Jordan Pickford: “No one will make a mistake as bad as mine for ages...” 👀 David De Gea: “Hold My beer” 😂😂 …
Oh no. Mustafi. No one will be left standing after this game. @Holmster79 Extremely poor mate. Desperate for us to nick it here but seems it is not going to be. Mustafi limping... Mustafi is limping. Long balls pls.
Oi fuck you Marcos Rojo. How many more Arsenal players you want hurt you piece of shit. ⚽️68' (Lacazette) Manchester United 1-2 Arsenal What a bizarre goal! Man U lose possession which Lacazette picks up, a 1-2 with Mkhitaryan and the ball trickles over the line. Premier League. This game is madness. 2-1 and 2-2 20 seconds later from Lingard! Rojo's mistake saved by Lingard, De Gea's mistake saved by Martial. Madness this game.
Seriously what are Leno and Kolasinac doing there? As soon as Leno fucks about Kolasinac should be clearing the fucking danger. Idiotic. 2-2. Bloody hell. Comical defending at both ends. Thought rojo was having a decent game up until that arsenal goal. Jesse Lingard has scored a Premier League goal for the first time since February (vs. Chelsea). Saving it for those big games.
That save by De Gea ends Aubameyang’s streak of scoring with 10 straight shots on target. Auba was yet to see his shots saved.. De Gea has so far saved two. Commentators wanking off that de gea save half the keepers in the prem should save that tbh.
Lingard scores for Man Utd, forgets he's 25 years old, and does one of his trademark shit dances. Minuto 67, gol Arsenal. Minuto 68, gol Manchester United. Premier League. How have we not scored? First Aubameyang then mkhitaryan, fucking Chelsea all over again, Fellaini on now game over.
@OfficialFPL For the love of everything that is holy you better give that fucking goal to Lacazette. 👊🏻. De Gea denies Aubameyang, then Mkhi fires over - both from balls in from Kolasinac. That's where all Arsenal's threat is coming from. Fellaini is on. Pogba on. Man United's team is now full with 15 mins to go and the game still 2-2.
Final sub for United. Lingard is replaced by Pogba. That sub simply has to be for Matic. He’s on his last legs... he’s been on his last legs all season! 102 - David De Gea is the first goalkeeper to save a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang shot on target in the Premier League since Łukasz Fabiański for West Ham 102 days ago, ending a run of 10 consecutive shots on target scored for the Arsenal striker. Streak.
David De Gea. Best Goalkeeper in the world. Never forget that. Not one good defender on the pitch at old trafford 😂. Is this the much improved Kolasinac, man can’t defend.
@Amzaki584mscd @brfootball Arsenal has made it entertaining. Great odds on a 90th minute winner here going in off Fellaini's arse. Guendouzi has been everywhere.
Andre Marriner just called a foul on a play that he literally had his back to. How can a ref give a foul when he has his back to the tackle the linesman doesn't give it 🤔. Andre Mariner has just blown for a foul that he ABSOLUTELY never saw. It was 100% behind his back but Fellaini was involved so he just gave a foul.
Chelsea dropping points United and Arsenal heading to a draw hopefully 👌 All is needed is city to drop points. The Ev drop more points, Chelsea drop more points, Utd and Arsenal currently 2-2, while the reds have overcome being kicked all over the fucking gaff and picked up 3 points.
Rashford's work rate is 🔥🔥🔥. Rashford's work rate today. Manchester United Full Time Ratings.
Fellaini pulling Guendouzi's hair. Clearly a hair inferiority complex being expressed through childish lashing out. Fellaini cut his hair off, then started pulling others hair and they cant get a revenge on him. Haha. fellaini has literally just played another players hair... that’s a grown man. in his 30s. pulling a teenagers hair.
United fans booing a 19 year old after Fellaini pulled his hair like a jealous twat.
this mkhitaryan goal shoulda counted, scrap the offside rule for just this one time smh. Such a poor United performance and we’ve only come out with a draw. Typical Arsenal even with their offside goal. Take that. Should have won really but an offside goal gives United a point. 20 games unbeaten. Up the Arsenal.
Marouane Fellaini so desperate for some of his own hair back he's trying to steal it off Matteo Guendouzi 😂 https… Liverpool in the Premier League this season: ✅ West Ham ✅ Crystal Palace ✅ Brighton ✅ Leicester ✅ Tottenham ✅ Southampton 🤝 Chelsea 🤝 City ✅ Huddersfield ✅ Cardiff 🤝 Arsenal ✅ Fulham ✅ Watford ✅ Everton ✅ Burnley 🔴. A lot of good saves from De Gea despite the save so at the same time I feel like we should’ve won but oh well a point at Old Trafford is always a good point.
United fans really booing 19 yo Guendouzi for out playing their entire midfield lol. Steve McManaman just gave Matic MOTM and I will never take any BT sport commentator seriously ever again. Matic man of the match i mean he was good today but motm is pushing it a bit.
Fellaini forever elbowing players and now united fans chanting same old arsenal always cheating. Only one who been cheating is their team. Are Man Utd fans complete wankers. Same old Arsenal, always cheating, from the biggest bunch of cunting cheats there is. @7amkickoff “Same old Arsenal, always cheating”. Pricks. Timely reminder that United and their fans really are the worst of the worst.
Full-time in tonight's final match as @ManUtd hold @Arsenal to a 2-2 draw. For reaction to all of tonight's action head here:. Arsenal could be running away with the league and United could be fighting relegation and they still wouldn't beat us at home. Well I'll take 3-1 to bounce back considering Chelsea lost and Arsenal drew.
Paul Pogba cost £89m, Romelu Lukaku cost £75m and Fred cost £47m. All together they cost the club £211m and neither of the 3 start tonight. “But José wasn’t backed.”. I swear no team rates Lukaku Arsenal came back in the second half once Martial came off for him. Typical Arsenal winning a big derby game then getting a draw vs a mid table side.
Premier League: United 2-2 Arsenal Tottenham 3-1 Southampton Wolves 2-1 Chelsea Fulham 1-1 Leicester Everton 1-1 Newcastle Burnley 1-2 Liverpool. @NepentheZ Man Utd robbed arsenal so badly, they always manage to get lucky against us. Was a good old fashioned United Arsenal game. Jose killed the momentum with those subs. What does Matic need to do before he gets subbed? This wasn’t Fellaini’s game. Jose killed this game with wrong subs. Point not enough. 📺 11pm - United Review;.
Yes, Arsenal was robbed by Utd's 12th man Yes, goals were still stupid to concede Yes, this had to be another win But 4 points from these 2 games is ok. 🐺 @Wolves this season: ✅ 2-1 vs @ChelseaFC 🤝 1-1 vs @ManCity 🤝 1-1 vs @ManUtd 🤝 1-1 vs @Arsenal ❌ 0-1 vs @OfficialBHAFC ❌ 0-2 vs @HTAFCdotcom ❌ 1-2 vs @CardiffCityFC 🤷‍♂ Play their best, against the best.

Ander Herrera's game by numbers vs. Arsenal: 2nd best pass accuracy (92%) most tackles attempted (8) most interceptions (6) most tackles won (5) most chances created (3) "Mad dog". 🐶🐶🐶. Okay performance, Good to see rojo and bailly back, martial saving Mourinho and matic motm??? 🤦🏾‍♂️. United fans really booing 19 yo Guendouzi for getting his air pulled after embarrassing their midfielders. …

I tot Herrera played better than Matic and deserves the MOTM.. Guendouzi was class tonight. Arsenal's next 6 fixtures: Huddersfield H FK Qarabag H Southampton A Tottenham H Burnley H Brighton A. I'm sorry but Pogba isn't World class. He might have a world cup winners medal BUT He doesn't play world class He doesn't act world class His penalties aren't world class His attitude isn't world class Is he talented ? of course. But the glimpses of that talent have been to few.
