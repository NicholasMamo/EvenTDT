05:13:08: INFO: 2018-12-05 21:46:32 55: Bellerin has had a really poor game tonight . Cheating fucks. I hate these lot. Clear Old Trafford call. If Bellerin's challenge is a yellow and Lingard's challenge was a yellow, there is no way Rojo's is also a yellow. The challenges weren't anywhere near comparable. Thats lacazette goal should count, no? MUFCv AFC. World class shithousery from Lacazette there.

Just what they needed after that testing week against Chelsea, Inter Milan and Arsenal. They barely had to get out of third gear. They downed tools a bit after going 3-0 up and Southampton could easily have scored more than one, but that was fairly routine.
05:19:47: INFO: 2018-12-05 21:53:09 59: Fellaini forever elbowing players and now united fans chanting same old arsenal always cheating. Only one who been cheating is their team.

Scandalous errors from DDG and Rojo gave him 2-2. Same story for all 3 years hes been here. Best manager in the world managing a bunch of coward donkeys.
05:24:29: INFO: 2018-12-05 21:57:55 62: Felt more like Old Trafford should tonight with a raucous atmosphere until the end; felt more like Manchester United and definitely felt like a proper United v Arsenal game. Enjoyed it.

Ander Herrera's game by numbers vs. Arsenal: 2nd best pass accuracy (92%) most tackles attempted (8) most interceptions (6) most tackles won (5) most chances created (3) "Mad dog". .
05:29:10: INFO: 2018-12-05 22:02:36 65: Rojo gave the ball away, was on a yellow, fouled Lacazette, scored an own goal, sent a long ball got an assist in 90 seconds. A largely disappointing performance result. However, 7 points out of Bournemouth away, Spurs at home United away is a respectable return. Also, the unbeaten streak is extended to 20. I think Xhakas absence was noticeable the introduction of VAR cant come soon enough.
05:30:41: INFO: 2018-12-05 22:04:11 66: It was Diogo Dalot's first start in the Premier League tonight. Played well for part of it but was also clear he lacks experience, especially in these bigger games. He needs time and should be afforded aplenty. Brighter days to come. "Same old Arsenal, always cheating," sing the Man Utd fans a few minutes after Fellaini dragged Guendouzi down by his ha
05:34:12: INFO: 2018-12-05 22:07:27 67: really disappointing! To have any hope of getting into the top 4 we have to beat mid table teams. Manchester United were lucky to get a draw at Old Trafford tonight! The Goal of Anthony Martial for Manchester United ! . Chelsea losing is good and they will lose again on Sunday vs City. They are behind Arsenal and Tottenham I think. Very confident of taking 3rd. Martial dived Their goal was offside Rojo shouldve been sent off for the right tackle on Auba Rojo shouldve been sent off for the foul on Lacazette Rojo was the one who played the long ball for their second Lacazette scored a fair goal that the ref disallowed for no reason.
05:35:55: INFO: 2018-12-05 22:09:13 68: Jose mourinho deserves to lose and we deserve to win this game hands down.  @Wolves this season:  2-1 vs @ChelseaFC  1-1 vs @ManCity  1-1 vs @ManUtd  1-1 vs @Arsenal  0-2 vs @HTAFCdotcom  1-2 vs @CardiffCityFC  0-1 vs @OfficialBHAFC  Play their best, against the best. So Arsenal couldnt beat our worst side in years and many of our fans are happy with that? F*** off .

Guess that just shows the difference in club expectations th Manchester United have conceded more goals than Everton, Bournemouth, Leicester, Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Brighton, West Ham, Wolves Watford. Its December.
05:41:21: INFO: 2018-12-05 22:14:33 71: @Arsenal Always sad to draw against mid table teams but , forward we match! Arsenal so useless. Expected them to flog us. Cant beat a team with Matic, Herrera in midfield. Cant help but crave attacking upgrades for Iwobi Mkhitaryan. Only then we will be contenders for 2nd taken seriously If Pogba is a virus then Matic is full on terminal illness.
05:44:30: INFO: 2018-12-05 22:18:00 72: @AdenY98 @UnitedAk @RoamingSix So that means he didn't manage a 2-0 he managed a 2-2 and Arsenal created 2 more cle Arsenal fans singing "Jose Mourinho, we want you to stay". Marvellous. Matic: Both teams attacked. It was a great game for the supporters but I thought we deserved a point. Everyone knows the confidence is not high, but this is the fight that we have to show. Everyone is ready to play wherever the manager asks..
