Michael Owen on Paul Pogba "He could do a lot worse than just go and watch a lot of Paul Scholes videos." Owen: I think he Pogba could do a lot worse than watching a load of videos of Paul Scholes. If he was playing under a Guardiola or a Klopp I think we would be looking at one of the best players in the world right now, but we can t say it. #mufc BT

Rojo can do a job at centre back, but he's a shocking left back. Rojo at left back is a no no.#MUFC RT @LiamPaulCanning: Marcos Rojo is not a left back.

I have no idea what Sir Alex drank the day he said Phil Jones could be this clubs greatest ever player, but I d lov https://t.co/WOFh3HZFsx Sir Alex didn t get a lot wrong, but saying Phil Jones could become United s greatest ever player was probably erroneous. I am old enough to remember when Sir Alex Ferguson said Phil Jones could be the greatest player in Manchester United s history #mufc

I don t know which own goal is worse; Phil Jones against Valencia or Theresa May winning the vote of confidence! Surely the players and fans should be able to do a vote of no confidence and get that Portuguese cunt out of the c https://t.co/IEuOtz8CQg RT @ericlalor: When are we having a vote of no confidence on Phil Jones?
Phil Jones has 5 career Manchester United goals and 5 career Manchester United own goals. RT @RedDevilCentral: Fun Fact: Phil Jones have scored five goals for #mufc, four of those have been own goals. RT @samuelluckhurst: Phil Jones has scored four own goals during his United career.
Phil Jones has to be one of the worst defenders of all time I've ever seen. Phil Jones, a short story @ManUtd get him out the jokes over https://t.co/lmvxFjNKQK RT @MatchoftheDave: We've been dining out on the Chris Smalling and Phil Jones joke for years and it does not get old. https://t.co/yjmvQXs 
People say Mourinho is a "proven winner" but a real winner adapts to the situation he's in &amp; looks for constant improvement. All I see is a washed up, miserable, moaning dinosaur who can't accept he isn't the only one with 100m to spend anymore. Just a reminder that Valencia are currently 15th in La Liga and playing Manchester United off the park tonight.
How do we go about a vote of no confidence against Mourinho @TotallyMUFC How many letters need to go in before we can get a vote of no confidence in Mourinho? Good of Phil Jones to keep the country s confidence and morale up what with #Brexit and the #ConfidenceVote

Could we have a no confidence vote against Phil Jones? "Like a cat trying to bury a shit in a marble floor" is the most accurate way to describe Phil Jones I've ever heard LIKE A CAT TRYING TO BURY A SHIT IN A MARBLE FLOOR!!
